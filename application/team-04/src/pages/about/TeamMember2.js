        I'm currently in my final year at San Francisco State University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. My journey in the world of programming has been quite the adventure, exploring languages like C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, and diving into the depths of database management with MySQL.
